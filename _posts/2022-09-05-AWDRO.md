#### Abstract

In this talk, we consider the sensitivity of distributionally robust optimization problem under an adapted Wasserstein perturbation. 
We extend the classical results in a static setting to the dynamic multi-period setting.
Under mild conditions, we give an explicit expression for the first order approximation to the value function.
An optimization problem with a cost of weak type will also be discussed.

See [slides](/assets/pdf/AWDRO.pdf) for more details.
