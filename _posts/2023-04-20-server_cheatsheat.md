## Jupyter Notebook

1. Login your remote server.

    ```shell
    ssh username@server
    ```

2. Create a remote jupyter notebook on the server.

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080
    ```

   Alternatively, you can define a macro in your configuration file (`.bashrc`) on the remote server.

    ```shell
    function nb(){
        jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080
    }
    ```

3. Open a new local terminal and connect to the remote jupyter notebook

    ```shell
    ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 username@server
    ```

4. Open <https://localhost:8080> in your browser.

## SSH

It is quite tedious to repeat above commands every time.
Here's how you can configure your own SSH profile to make it easier to connect to your remote server:

1. Add the following profile to your `.ssh/config` file.

    ```nginx
    Host myhost
        Hostname server
        User username
        Port myport
        LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
    ```

2. Connect and listen to the remote server simply through `ssh myhost`.

## Tmux

Tmux is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal.

1. Install [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) and [Tmux Resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect).
2. Start a new session with the name *mysession*.

    ```shell
    tmux new -s mysession
    ```

3. Save a session by `Ctrl-b+Ctrl-s` and restore a session by `Ctrl-b+Crtl-r`.
4. Show all sessions.

    ```shell
    tmux list-session
    ```

5. Kill session *mysession*.

    ```shell
    tmux kill-session -t mysession
    ```
