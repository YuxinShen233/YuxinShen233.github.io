Hi, all!

I am Yifan Jiang (蒋亦凡), a second-year student in the Mathematics of Random Systems CDT. 
Before coming to Oxford, I studied as an undergraduate in Mathematics at Fudan University. 
I have a broad interest in stochastic analysis and its applications in finance.

It is my honor to be supervised by Professor Jan Obłój and Professor Gui-Qiang Chen. 
My DPhil research is focused on the Wasserstein distributional sensitivity to model uncertainty in dynamic context.
