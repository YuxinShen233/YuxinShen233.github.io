Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of capturing the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Regularization techniques add constraints or penalties to the model to improve its ability to generalize.</p> <h3 id="how-does-overfitting-happen">How Does Overfitting Happen?</h3> <ul> <li><strong>High model complexity:</strong> Too many parameters can lead to memorization rather than learning meaningful patterns.</li> <li><strong>Insufficient training data:</strong> Small datasets may cause models to fit noise rather than actual trends.</li> <li><strong>Noisy data:</strong> Irrelevant or redundant features can mislead the model.</li> </ul> <h2 id="what-is-l1-and-l2-regularization">What is L1 and L2 Regularization?</h2> <p>L1 and L2 regularization are two common approaches to prevent overfitting by modifying the loss function of a model:</p> <h4 id="l1-regularization-lasso-regression">L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)</h4> <p>L1 regularization adds the <strong>absolute</strong> value of the coefficients to the loss function: \(Loss = \text{MSE} + \lambda \sum |w_i|\)</p> <ul> <li>Encourages sparsity by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero.</li> <li>Useful for feature selection as it removes irrelevant features.</li> <li>Can lead to better interpretability.</li> </ul> <h4 id="l2-regularization-ridge-regression">L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)</h4> <p>L2 regularization adds the <strong>squared</strong> value of the coefficients to the loss function:</p> \[Loss = \text{MSE} + \lambda\sum w_i^2\] <ul> <li>Penalizes large weights but does not shrink them to zero.</li> <li>Helps in reducing multicollinearity (high correlation between features).</li> <li>Generally leads to better stability and prevents large parameter values.</li> </ul> <h4 id="elastic-net-regularization">Elastic Net Regularization</h4> <p>Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 penalties: \(Loss = \text{MSE} + \lambda_1 \sum |w_i| + \lambda_2 \sum w_i^2\)</p> <ul> <li>Balances between feature selection (L1) and weight shrinkage (L2).</li> <li>Useful when there are correlated features.</li> <li>Often preferred in practical applications to get the best of both worlds.</li> </ul> <h3 id="why-is-l2-regularization-useful">Why is L2 regularization useful?</h3> <p>L1 regularization encourages sparsity and reduces model complexity. L2 regularization only penalizes large weights but does not shrink them to zero. How does L2 prevent overfitting?</p> <ul> <li>When weights are large, small changes in input features can result in disproportionately large changes in predictions, making the model highly sensitive to noise (overfitting). By shrinking weights, L2 regularization forces the model to be more stable and less sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data.</li> <li>L2 distributes the impact across multiple features, reducing the risk of the model relying too much on noise in individual features.</li> <li>In cases where features are highly correlated, the model may assign arbitrarily large positive and negative weights to compensate for these correlations, leading to instability. L2 regularization reduces this effect by shrinking the coefficients and stabilizing the model.</li> </ul> <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4> <p>L2 does not force weights to zero but shrinks them, leading to a more stable and generalizable model. By preventing excessively large weights, L2 reduces sensitivity to noise and avoids overfitting. It helps with multicollinearity and distributes learning across multiple features.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Both L1 and L2 regularization help mitigate overfitting, but they have different effects on model complexity and feature selection. L1 is ideal when feature selection is needed, while L2 is better for stable and well-distributed parameter values. In practice, <strong>Elastic Net</strong>, a combination of L1 and L2 is often used to balance both effects.</p> <p>By understanding these techniques, you can make informed decisions when designing ML models and improving generalization performance!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ML"/><category term="learning"/><category term="blogs"/><category term="Classical ML"/><category term="regularization"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[ML blogs - Classical ML 1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Improving the generalization of protein expression models with mechanistic sequence information</title><link href="https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2025/NARpaper/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Improving the generalization of protein expression models with mechanistic sequence information"/><published>2025-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2025/NARpaper</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2025/NARpaper/"><![CDATA[<p>Excited to share our latest work on improving the generalization of protein expression models, which has just been online in Nucleic Acids Research!</p> <p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/53/3/gkaf020/7985285">Check the paper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/YuxinShen233/MF_for_generalization">Check the repo</a>.</p> <p>🧬 We show that integrating mechanistic sequence features—such as mRNA stability, codon usage, and peptide properties—can enhance model generalization, improving predictive accuracy for novel sequences.</p> <p>🖥️ We explore multiple strategies to combine mechanistic features with standard encodings, including feature stacking, ensemble stacking, and geometric stacking with graph neural networks.</p> <p>💡 This work highlights the importance of domain knowledge and feature engineering in ML-driven sequence design, offering new insights for applications in synthetic biology and strain engineering.</p> <p>Huge thanks to my supervisors, Dr Diego Oyarzún and Prof Grzegorz Kudla for their guidance and support throughout this project!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="DNA representation"/><category term="Graph Neural Network"/><category term="AI and Biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper accepted in NAR]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Turing Institute Interest Group seminar series</title><link href="https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2024/DCBTuring/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Turing Institute Interest Group seminar series"/><published>2024-10-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-10-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2024/DCBTuring</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yuxinshen233.github.io/blog/2024/DCBTuring/"><![CDATA[<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>I am co-organising a Turing Institute Interest Group seminar series on <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-centric-biological-design-and-engineering">Data-Centric Biological Design &amp; Engineering</a>.

In this project, we combined the BOPE pipeline with a language model, using the language model as the decision-maker. We worked on a multi-pbjective optimization problem (optimal production of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction) with this pipeline.
